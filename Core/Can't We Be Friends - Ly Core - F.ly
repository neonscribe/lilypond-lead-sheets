I thought I'd found the man of my dreams.
Now it seems, this is how the stor -- y ends.
He's goin' to turn me down and say,
“Can't we be friends?”
I thought for once it could -- n't go wrong,
Not for long! I can see the way this ends.
He's goin' to turn me down and say
“Can't we be friends?”
Nev -- er a -- gain! Through with love,
Through with men!
They play their game with -- out shame,
And who's to blame?
I thought I'd found a man I could trust,
What a bust! This is how the stor -- y ends.
He's goin' to turn me down and say,
“Can't we be friends?”

I thought I knew the wheat from the chaff,
What a laugh! This is how the stor -- y ends.
I let him turn me down and say,
“Can't we be friends?”
I act -- ed like a kid out of school,
What a fool! now I see the way this ends.
I let him turn me down and say,
“Can't we be friends?”
Why should I care,
Though he gave me the air?
Why should I cry,
Heave a sigh, and won -- der why?
I should have seen the sig -- nal to stop,
What a flop! This is how the stor -- y ends
I let him turn me down and say,
“Can't we be friends?”
